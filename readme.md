CONDITIONS EXERCISE 1
Skills: Conditions

Heating/Cooling exercise:
Define two variables: actualTemp and a desiredTemp. Write conditionals to tell the heating & cooling system what to do. Log one of these three things: Run A/C, Run heat, or Standby.

Extended Challenges second exercise:
Start with two variables: tempCelsius (a number) and targetUnit (a string, either “C”, “F”, or “K”). Write a switch statement that checks the targetUnit and logs the temperature converted to that unit. Notes: K stands for Kelvin. C requires no conversion, print out the original temp.


CONDITIONS EXERCISE 2
Skills: Conditions

Task: Identify the longest of three names.

Build Specifications:
Start with three variables name1, name2, and name3 which hold three names.

The code should output the longest of the three names. e.g., "Ada Lovelace has the longest name.". If there is a tie between any two, list both. e.g., “Charles and Brendan tie for the longest name.”. Or if all three names are the same length, output “All three names, Dorothy, Charles, and Brendan, are the same length.”

Make sure to test your code with many different combinations of lengths. There are 7 possible outcomes.
